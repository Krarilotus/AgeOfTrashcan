Base SVG Assets

Files:
- `player_age_1.svg` ... `player_age_7.svg`
- `enemy_age_1.svg` ... `enemy_age_7.svg`

Naming:
- `{side}_age_{N}.svg`
- `side`: `player` or `enemy`
- `N`: age level

Note:
- Runtime currently uses original procedural base rendering for exact legacy parity.
- These SVGs are the organized base asset set for future switch-over.
